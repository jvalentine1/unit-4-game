# unit-4-game

1) This is essentially a memory game, the variable computerScore generates a random number between 19-120 using the math.random function and then the value is pushed to html.

2) Each variable gem also generates a random number using math.random, however, that information is not pushed to the html until the user activates the on.click function of one of the gem images. 

3) once the user has matched the computer score they will be alerted you win and all functions will freeze except for the start button which is used to restart the game. 

4) If the user exceeds the computer number they will be alerted you lose and all functions will freeze until the start button is initialized. 

5) All stats will updated accordingly as the user continues to play, wins, losses and game #.
